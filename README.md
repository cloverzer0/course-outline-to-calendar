# Course Outline to Calendar

## Overview

An AI-powered web application that automatically converts course outline PDFs into calendar events, eliminating the tedious manual process of setting up academic calendars.

## Problem Statement

Many students rely on digital calendars to keep their academic lives organized—tracking classes, assignment deadlines, tests, office hours, and locations. While this system is effective, setting it up is unnecessarily tedious.

All of this critical information is provided by professors in a course outline, typically as a PDF document. Although course outlines are essential, they are static, text-heavy, and difficult to navigate. Students must repeatedly open and scan these PDFs to find small but important details, such as upcoming deadlines or office hours, until the information is fully memorized.

As a result, students are forced to manually extract information from course outlines and create individual calendar events themselves—a time-consuming, repetitive, and error-prone process.

## Solution

This project addresses that problem by converting course outlines directly into calendar events. By uploading a course outline to the application, students can automatically generate an importable .ics calendar file containing all relevant academic events, eliminating manual setup and making course information immediately accessible.

- Select core technologies:
  - Frontend: React / Next.js
  - Backend API: FastAPI (Python)
  - PDF text extraction library
  - AI/NLP processing (LangChain or similar)
  - Calendar generation using iCalendar (.ics) standard
- Define a unified calendar event data model:
  - Title/Course Name (required)
  - Start date/time (required)
  - End date/time (required)
  - Location (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Recurrence rules (icalendar supports this) (required)
- Set up repository structure, environment configuration, and basic CI workflow

**Deliverable:** Running skeleton app with frontend ↔ backend communication

---

### Phase 2: Course Outline Input & Validation
**Goal:** Allow users to submit course outlines safely and reliably

- Implement user interface for:
  - PDF file upload
  - (Optional) pasted text input
- Enforce file constraints:
  - Accepted formats (PDF)
  - File size limits
- Validate uploads before processing
- Provide immediate user feedback on upload success or failure

**Deliverable:** Validated course outline successfully accepted by the system

---

### Phase 3: PDF Text Extraction & Cleaning
**Goal:** Convert static PDFs into usable text

- Extract text from uploaded PDFs
  - Support multi-page documents

- Deduplicate repeated events
- Apply consistent naming and descriptions

**Deliverable:** Validated list of structured calendar events

---

### Phase 6: User Review & Editing
**Goal:** Give users control before calendar export

- Display a preview of all generated events

  - No events detected
  - PDF parsing errors
  - Invalid or missing data
- Provide clear error and success messages
- Test with multiple real course outlines
- Verify calendar imports across platforms
- Prepare a clean demo workflow: **Upload → Review → Download → Import**

**Deliverable:** Stable, demo-ready MVP

## Team Work Assignment, Responsibilities & Dependencies

**Team Size:** 4 Engineers

### Global Dependency (Applies to Everyone)

#### Event Data Model & API Contract (Highest Priority)

- **Must be defined and locked early in Phase 1**
- **Shared by Engineers 1, 2, 3, and 4**

Any late change impacts:
- Frontend rendering

- Backend validation
- Calendar generation

**Locked Fields:**
- `title`
- `startDateTime`
- `endDateTime`
- `location`
- `description`
- `recurrence`
- `needsReview` (optional / confidence flag)

**Changing this late causes widespread rework and integration risk.**
